# MC-Endgame

## About the Project

MC-Endgame is a Minecraft server plugin that enhances the endgame experience by introducing a new level of progression.

Once players have successfully defeated the wither and obtained a sufficient amount of netherite ingots, they gain the ability to craft a special item called the `Map-Device`. This device opens
portals, granting access to a series of increasingly challenging dungeons. These dungeons not only provide formidable foes and obstacles but also offer intriguing and valuable treasures to be
discovered along the way.
